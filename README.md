## 🗂 Project Structure

```
neonlib/
├── app.py          ← Streamlit UI only. Zero business logic.
├── auth.py         ← Login, Register, Session management
├── services.py     ← ALL business rules (issue, return, fines, requests…)
├── utils.py        ← Pure algorithms (search, sort, hash, ID generators)
├── models.py       ← Data shapes: User, Book, IssuedBook dataclasses
├── database.py     ← ONLY file that touches SQLite
├── seed.py         ← One-time sample data loader
├── library.db      ← Auto-created SQLite database
└── README.md
```

### Layer Rules (strict)
```
app.py  →  auth.py  →  database.py
app.py  →  services.py  →  database.py  +  utils.py
app.py  →  database.py  (read-only helpers like counts)
NEVER: app.py touches sqlite3 directly
NEVER: services.py imports streamlit
```
